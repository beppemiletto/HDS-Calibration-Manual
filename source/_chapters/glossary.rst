    ASIC
        An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a microchip designed for a special application, such as a particular kind of transmission protocol or a hand-held computer. You might contrast it with general integrated circuits, such as the microprocessor and the random access memory chips in your PC. ASICs are used in a wide-range of applications, including auto emission control, environmental monitoring, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). An ASIC can be pre-manufactured for a special application or it can be custom manufactured (typically using components from a "building block" library of components) for a particular customer application.

    DFSO
        Deceleration Fuel Shut Off alias Cut-Off, is the complete cut of fuel injection operated when a negative torque is requested to the engine. Occurs when the accelerator pedal is fully released and engine start decelerate. During this mode the injection is totally stopped and engine operate only a fresh air pumping, normally emphasizing the 'engine breaking effect'.

    DTC
        Diagnostic Trouble Codes or OBD2 Trouble Codes are codes that the car’s OBD system uses to notify you about an issue. Each code corresponds to a fault detected in the car. When the vehicle detects an issue, it will activate the corresponding trouble code.

    ECU
    ECM
        Engine Control Unit (Module) in the context of this document. The acronym may also refer more generally to Electronic Control Unit (Module), a larger and indefinite family of electronic controllers to which the engine control unit belongs.

    IC
        Instrumentation Cluster , also called often Dashboard is the instrumented part of the cockpit with driver's indicators, gauges, lamps, odometer, speedometers, etc...


    OEM
        OEM (pronounced as separate letters) is short for original equipment manufacturer, which is a somewhat misleading term used to describe a company that produces and resell to final customer product. Typically used for the vehicle manufacturer. More generally OEMs are manufacturers who resell another company's product under their own name and branding.

    MST
        Metatron Service Tool - The diagnostic tool provided by Metatron for HDS system

    RAM
        Random Access Memory - the volatile memory of the microprocessor of the :term:`ECM`.

    RF
        Radio Frequency. Used in the context of the electromagnetic sources of noise that affect the electrical wiring and circuitry of the ECM, means the high frequency in the bands of Radio Broadcasting waves: mostly above 30 kHz up to 30 GHz.

    SOP
        Literally Start Of Production - is the project phase that conclude the development and start the exploitation in terms of production volumes generation.

    TCM
        Transmission Control Module - The transmission control module can be a standalone controller or located in the (PCM) powertrain control module. The TCM receives input from various sensors and then uses this information to activate the (TCC) torque converter clutch, control line pressure and provide smooth shift timing. The TCM has preset data to compare these inputs and make the appropriate decision.

    TDC
        Top Dead Center - The engine angular location when a piston reach the uppermost position (closest to cylinder head) in a cylinder. In 4 strokes engine TDC is reached twice per cycle, end of compression and end of exhaust phases. By default TDC refers to the first of the two, the end of intake phase, since it is the active phase of the combusion cycle when the combustion is normally already started. Also called the firing TDC.

    UDS
        Universal Diagnostic Services - The worldwide most common protocol for diagnostic tools typically based on CAN bus

    VCM
    BCM
    CVC
        Vehicle Control Module - Body Control Module - Central Vehicle Controller. In automotive electronics, vehicle/body/central control module or 'body computer' is a generic term for an electronic control unit responsible for monitoring and controlling various electronic accessories in a vehicle's body.

    WIP
        Work In Progress - some item that is under development but still not ready.

    XCP
        XCP (or) "Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol" is a network protocol originating from ASAM for connecting calibration systems to electronic control units, ECUs. It enables read and write access to variables and memory contents of microcontroller systems at runtime. Entire datasets can be acquired or stimulated synchronous to events triggered by timers or operating conditions. In addition, XCP also supports programming of flash memory.

        ASAM states "The primary purpose of XCP is to adjust internal parameters and acquire the current values of internal variables of an ECU. The first letter X in XCP expresses the fact that the protocol is designed for a variety of bus systems."
