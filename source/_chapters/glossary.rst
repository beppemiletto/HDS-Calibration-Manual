    ASIC
        An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a microchip designed for a special application, such as a particular kind of transmission protocol or a hand-held computer. You might contrast it with general integrated circuits, such as the microprocessor and the random access memory chips in your PC. ASICs are used in a wide-range of applications, including auto emission control, environmental monitoring, and personal digital assistants (PDAs). An ASIC can be pre-manufactured for a special application or it can be custom manufactured (typically using components from a "building block" library of components) for a particular customer application.

    COP
        Conformity of Production (COP) is a means of evidencing the ability to produce a series of products that exactly match the specification, performance and marking requirements outlined in the type approval documentation.  Whether you are a manufacturer, or the agent applying for approvals on behalf of a manufacturer, and whatever your product is, suitable COP arrangements must be made.

    DFSO
        Deceleration Fuel Shut Off alias Cut-Off, is the complete cut of fuel injection operated when a negative torque is requested to the engine. Occurs when the accelerator pedal is fully released and engine start decelerate. During this mode the injection is totally stopped and engine operate only a fresh air pumping, normally emphasizing the 'engine breaking effect'.

    DTC
        Diagnostic Trouble Codes or OBD2 Trouble Codes are codes that the car’s OBD system uses to notify you about an issue. Each code corresponds to a fault detected in the car. When the vehicle detects an issue, it will activate the corresponding trouble code.

    ECU
    ECM
        Engine Control Unit (Module) in the context of this document. The acronym may also refer more generally to Electronic Control Unit (Module), a larger and indefinite family of electronic controllers to which the engine control unit belongs.

    FSM
        Finite-state machine - `From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - FSM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`_
        A finite-state machine (FSM) or finite-state automaton (FSA, plural: automata), finite automaton, or simply a state machine, is a mathematical model of computation. It is an abstract machine that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time. The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a transition. An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition. Finite-state machines are of two types—deterministic finite-state machines and non-deterministic finite-state machines. A deterministic finite-state machine can be constructed equivalent to any non-deterministic one.

    IC
        Instrumentation Cluster , also called often Dashboard is the instrumented part of the cockpit with driver's indicators, gauges, lamps, odometer, speedometers, etc...


    OEM
        OEM (pronounced as separate letters) is short for original equipment manufacturer, which is a somewhat misleading term used to describe a company that produces and resell to final customer product. Typically used for the vehicle manufacturer. More generally OEMs are manufacturers who resell another company's product under their own name and branding.

    ONE-BOX
    TWO-BOX
        In the Engine Control System context the ONE-BOX definition applies to a vehicle system integration where the :term:`ECM` is the Main On Board Computer that take care of receive and manage all the vehicle's (human and on board subsystems) inputs for the performance request to the engine.
        The TWO-BOX definition applies to a vehicle system integration where the :term:`VCM` is the Main On Board Computer that take care of receive and manage all the vehicle's (human and on board subsystems) inputs for the performance request to the engine. In this case the VCM transmits to ECM the composite request by means of a digital connection (i.e. vehicle CAN bus).

    MPI
        Multiple Points Injection (aka Multipoint Injection). Every inlet port of the engine has its own injector (or set of injectors) that delivers the fuel in the intaked air stream.

    MST
        Metatron Service Tool - The diagnostic tool provided by Metatron for HDS system

    PWM
    PDM
        `From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia PWM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse-width_modulation>`_

        Pulse-width modulation (PWM), or pulse-duration modulation (PDM), is a method of reducing the average power delivered by an electrical signal, by effectively chopping it up into discrete parts. The average value of voltage (and current) fed to the load is controlled by turning the switch between supply and load on and off at a fast rate. The longer the switch is on compared to the off periods, the higher the total power supplied to the load. Along with maximum power point tracking (MPPT), it is one of the primary methods of reducing the output of solar panels to that which can be utilized by a battery.[1] PWM is particularly suited for running inertial loads such as motors, which are not as easily affected by this discrete switching, because their inertia causes them to react slowly. The PWM switching frequency has to be high enough not to affect the load, which is to say that the resultant waveform perceived by the load must be as smooth as possible.

        The rate (or frequency) at which the power supply must switch can vary greatly depending on load and application. For example, switching has to be done several times a minute in an electric stove; 120 Hz in a lamp dimmer; between a few kilohertz (kHz) and tens of kHz for a motor drive; and well into the tens or hundreds of kHz in audio amplifiers and computer power supplies. The main advantage of PWM is that power loss in the switching devices is very low. When a switch is off there is practically no current, and when it is on and power is being transferred to the load, there is almost no voltage drop across the switch. Power loss, being the product of voltage and current, is thus in both cases close to zero. PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle. PWM has also been used in certain communication systems where its duty cycle has been used to convey information over a communications channel.

    PTO
        `From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia PTO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_take-off>`_ . A power take-off or power takeoff (PTO) is any of several methods for taking power from a power source, such as a running engine, and transmitting it to an application such as an attached implement or separate machine. Most commonly, it is a splined drive shaft installed on a tractor or truck allowing implements with mating fittings to be powered directly by the engine.

        Semi-permanently mounted power take-offs can also be found on industrial and marine engines. These applications typically use a drive shaft and bolted joint to transmit power to a secondary implement or accessory. In the case of a marine application, such shafts may be used to power fire pumps.

    RAM
        Random Access Memory - the volatile memory of the microprocessor of the :term:`ECM`.

    RF
        Radio Frequency. Used in the context of the electromagnetic sources of noise that affect the electrical wiring and circuitry of the ECM, means the high frequency in the bands of Radio Broadcasting waves: mostly above 30 kHz up to 30 GHz.

    SOP
        Literally Start Of Production - is the project phase that conclude the development and start the exploitation in terms of production volumes generation.

    SPI
        Single Point Injection (aka Singlepoint Injection or Central Injection). Identifies an injection layout where a single fuel metering device is located in single position. The metering device can be a set of injectors grouped in a single downstream fuel rail that deliver the fuel in the intaked air stream at a single location (usually right after the throttle body).

    TCM
        Transmission Control Module - The transmission control module can be a standalone controller or located in the (PCM) powertrain control module. The TCM receives input from various sensors and then uses this information to activate the (TCC) torque converter clutch, control line pressure and provide smooth shift timing. The TCM has preset data to compare these inputs and make the appropriate decision.

    TDC
        Top Dead Center - The engine angular location when a piston reach the uppermost position (closest to cylinder head) in a cylinder. In 4 strokes engine TDC is reached twice per cycle, end of compression and end of exhaust phases. By default TDC refers to the first of the two, the end of intake phase, since it is the active phase of the combusion cycle when the combustion is normally already started. Also called the firing TDC.

    UDS
        Universal Diagnostic Services - The worldwide most common protocol for diagnostic tools typically based on CAN bus

    VCM
    BCM
    CVC

In automotive electronics, vehicle/body/central control module or 'body computer' is a generic term for an electronic control unit responsible for monitoring and controlling various electronic accessories in a vehicle's body.

    WIP
        Work In Progress - some item that is under development but still not ready.

    XCP
        XCP (or) "Universal Measurement and Calibration Protocol" is a network protocol originating from ASAM for connecting calibration systems to electronic control units, ECUs. It enables read and write access to variables and memory contents of microcontroller systems at runtime. Entire datasets can be acquired or stimulated synchronous to events triggered by timers or operating conditions. In addition, XCP also supports programming of flash memory.

        ASAM states "The primary purpose of XCP is to adjust internal parameters and acquire the current values of internal variables of an ECU. The first letter X in XCP expresses the fact that the protocol is designed for a variety of bus systems."
