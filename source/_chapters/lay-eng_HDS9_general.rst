Session contents
----------------

While the previous sections of the present HDS User Application Manual contains all essential information for the technicians to make full use of the information system and a description of the system functions, capabilities, contingencies, alternate modes of operation and step-by-step procedures for system access and use, section II provides detailed information about ECU base calibration on engine dyno.

It deals with off-line calibration of sensors and actuators using CanApe in Emulation Mode or INCA without full HW-access, first off-line calibration attempt of modelsâ€™ main parameters and on-line calibration of:

* Engine modes
* Engine states
* Air management
* Injection laws
* Closed loop control of exhaust oxygen content
* Ignition timing
* Idle regulation
* Boost management

.. note:: CALIBRATION STEP -> DESK CALIBRATIONS

    This step concerns a series of operations that can be performed before fitting the ECU on the engine, such as:

    1. sensors signal conversion

    2. actuators parameters setting

    3. engine parameters setting

    4. engine timing configuration

.. TODO: Link to other chapters of above list
