# HDS-Calibration-Manual
The repository for the concurrent development of Metatron HDS9 Calibration Manual documentation

## Project Descritpion

The Calibration Manual, also defined as Application Manual of HDS version 9 is a set of instructables that inform the system user how to set properly the available engine control functions by means of enabling and calibrating them.

HDS stands for Heavy Duty System and is the commercial name of a embedded controller dedicated to Heavy Duty engines running on Natural Gas with Spark Ingition (Otto) combustion cycle.

The application of this system cover engines from 4 to 8 cylinders with a wide range of powers and torque output.


##	Specification
###	Format
The HDS Application Manual document is provided in HTML format as reference target. The template system is optimized for the rendering in an HTML folders and files system that can be delivered for local browsing on a PC or served in a basic static HTML server. Optionally can be saved in LaTeX format for following conversion in PDF format.
###	Sources
Source files are written using the “reStructuredText” language.  reStructuredText (RST, ReST, or reST) is a file format for textual data used primarily in the Python programming language community for technical documentation. 
###	Compiler (render engine)
The sources are compiled into HTML format or optionally in  LaTeX using Sphinx . 
Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license. It was originally created for the Python documentation, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. Of course, this site is also created from reStructuredText sources using Sphinx! 
###	Versioning
The sources of the Application Manual are versioned using Git .
